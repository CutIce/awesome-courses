That's why it's so important to learn techniques of **testing** and **debugging**, which help us act as detectives, evaluating hypotheses about what in our code works properly and what doesn't.  Then we can act on those hypotheses to implement fixes.  This recitation is all about that detective process, focusing on the fundamentals.

Therefore, it pays to write your own small tests!  Also, you can implement tests simply with `assert` statements, rather than using a fancy testing framework.  Let's write a function that takes in an implementation of `backwards` and tests it.  (Why make `backwards` an argument to the testing function?  That's so we can reuse this tester for other function versions later.)\n",

So we'll go with the assumption here that we shouldn't be mutating our input (though it might be good to document that explicitly as part of the docstring!).\n",

Start adding tests that will eventually cover all the tricky cases.  It usually makes sense to develop the tests in increasing order of complexity.  Save them all in a simple function that you can call on your code over and over again as you develop it.  (You can also use a fancy framework like `pytest`, as our official grading system uses, but that's going above and beyond the essence of strategic testing.)\n",

But some are easier to read/understand, and some have more or fewer places for bugs to hide, so to speak.  Python gives us lots of neat built-in ways to make things more concise, but one could argue that the third version of `backwards` below has taken things too far, and that, while it is concise, it is difficult to read/understand/debug."
