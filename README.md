**Writting at the Beginning of Learning Awesome Courses on the Internet**

This repo includes the metarials, slides, homework, notes and perceptions about awesome courses I learn from the internet.

I will also list them as follow, and introduce green hands to find the roadmap.

I wish I can stick to it.



###  **Algorithm** 

1. Algorithm Part 1  from Coursera , Princeton



### Mechine Learning

1. Mechine Learning in Coursera. Andrew Wu 

**Remark:** It's a very interesting and easy course which can take you quickly enter the amazing world of mechine learning. I think you can learn many basic and important thoughts from it.



### Pattern Recognition

University: FDU

Professor:  **Qiu Xipeng**

Time: AI+X 21Spring

**Remark:** A excellent course contains detailed knowledge about Nerve Network and Pattern Rocognition. Prof. Qiu also share his e-book : [https://nndl.github.io/](https://nndl.github.io/) ,I think it's a good choice to read this after learning Mechine Learning of Andrew Wu.



### CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2018

University: UCB

Professor(Instructors): Pieter Abbeel, Dan Klein

Time: 21 Spring

Remark: It's a coincidence to encounter this course. I learn another course nameed "The Foundation of Artificial Intelligence", but the course is a bit boring, I decide to learn this course to take the place of that one.
